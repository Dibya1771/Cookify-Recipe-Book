Once it starts boiling, add the lemon juice and stir gently until the milk curdles and separates into curds (chenna) and whey. Turn off the heat.\n2. Line a colander with a cheesecloth or muslin cloth. Pour the curdled milk into the colander, allowing the whey to drain away. Rinse the curds under cold water to remove any traces of lemon juice.\n3. Gather the edges of the cloth and squeeze out any excess liquid from the curds. Hang the cloth with the curds for about 30 minutes to allow further draining and firming.\n4. After 30 minutes, remove the curds from the cloth and transfer them to a clean surface. Knead the curds with the heel of your hand for about 5-7 minutes until it forms a smooth and soft dough.\n5. Divide the dough into small portions and roll them into smooth balls, applying gentle pressure. Make sure there are no cracks on the surface of the balls.\n6. In a large pot, combine the granulated sugar, water, and saffron strands (if using). Bring the mixture to a boil, stirring until the sugar is completely dissolved.\n7. Gently slide the prepared balls (rasgulla) into the boiling sugar syrup. Cover the pot with a lid and let it simmer over medium heat for about 10-12 minutes. The rasgullas will expand in size as they cook.\n8. Remove the pot from heat and let the rasgullas cool down to room temperature. They will shrink slightly as they cool.\n9. Once cooled, transfer the rasgullas along with the sugar syrup to a serving bowl. Sprinkle cardamom powder over the top and garnish with chopped pistachios.\n10. Refrigerate the rasgullas for a few hours to chill before serving. Serve them cold and enjoy the sweet and spongy rasgullas!",
